# SVHN-Image-Classification

SVHN image dataset consists nearly 100k images including both train and validation. the data saved in matlab format 
and each image has the shape of (32,32,3). The main difference between SVHN and MNIST dataset is that MNIST images 
are Grayscale ( 1 channel) while SVHN images are RGB ( 3 channels).
